Algotith for finding path between two vertices in a graph using a depth first search approach.

When exploring the neighbors of a vertex, the default approach follows the order that the
adjacency list returns the neighbors.

However for Integer Vertices specifically, the method of exploration finds the next neighbor
with the cheapest cost. The cost of moving from one vertex to another equals the square of the difference
between the two vertices;
